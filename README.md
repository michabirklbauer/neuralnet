# Neural Network Implementation in NumPy

A "from scratch" implementation of classic feed-forward neural networks for
binary/multi-class classification using ReLU activations, cross entropy loss and
sigmoid/softmax output.

Read through the documentation in `neuralnet.py` for a description of the
implementation.

An example usage of `neuralnet.py` is given in the `Usage.ipynb` notebook.

Alternatively you can open the whole code in Google Colab -> [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michabirklbauer/neuralnet/neuralnet-colab.ipynb).

## Requirements

`neuralnet.py` is purely implemented in NumPy:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): `pip install numpy`

To run the examples in the `Usage.ipynb` notebook locally please install the
requirements noted in `requirements.txt`:
- [Requirements](https://github.com/michabirklbauer/neuralnet/blob/master/requirements.txt): `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data

The following datasets are used in the examples:
- Multi-class classification: [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html)
- Binary-class classification: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)
